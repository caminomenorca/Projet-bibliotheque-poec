Week 1:

    Week 1:

    Set up the project structure and create a new React and Express project:
        Create a new directory for the project on your local machine
        Initialize the project as a React project using the create-react-app command
        Create a new directory within the project for the Express server
        Initialize the Express server by creating an index.js file and installing the necessary dependencies (e.g. express, cors, body-parser, etc.)
    Install the necessary dependencies for React, Express and Sequelize:
        In the root of the React project, install any additional dependencies for the front-end (e.g. react-router-dom, axios, etc.)
        In the Express server directory, install any additional dependencies for the back-end (e.g. sequelize, sqlite3, etc.)
    Build the login and registration pages for users using React:
        Create a new directory within the src directory of the React project for the login and registration pages
        Within this directory, create the necessary components for the login and registration pages (e.g. input fields, buttons, etc.)
        Implement the logic for handling user input and form submission within the components using state and setState
        Create a new directory within the src directory for handling authentication (e.g. auth)
        Within this directory, create a new file for handling authentication requests to the server using axios
        Connect the React components to the Express back-end routes for handling user authentication by importing the auth file and using its methods (e.g. sending login/registration data to the server, receiving and handling responses, etc.)
    Build the back-end routes and controllers for handling user authentication using Express and Sequelize:
        In the index.js file, import the necessary middlewares and set up the server
        Create a new directory within the Express server directory for handling authentication (e.g. auth)
        Within this directory, create new files for the routes and controllers for handling login and registration requests
        In the routes file, create the necessary routes for handling login and registration requests (e.g. /login, /register, etc.) and import the corresponding controllers
        In the controllers file, create the necessary controllers for handling the requests, validating the data and interacting with the database using sequelize
        Implement the logic for generating and checking user tokens for authentication by creating a new file for handling JWT and import it in the controllers

Week 2:

    Build the library pages for displaying books using React:
        Create the necessary components for displaying the books in a list or grid format
        Implement the logic for fetching the books data from the server and displaying it in the components
    Build the back-end routes and controllers for handling book data using Express and Sequelize:
        Create the necessary routes for handling book data requests (e.g. fetching all books, fetching a single book, etc.)
        Create the necessary controllers for handling the requests and interacting with the database using sequelize

Week 3:

    Build the personal library pages for users using React:
        Create the necessary components for displaying the books in a list or grid format
        Implement the logic for fetching the personal library data from the server and displaying it in the components
    Build the back-end routes and controllers for handling personal library data using Express and Sequelize:
        Create the necessary routes for handling personal library data requests (e.g. fetching a user's personal library, adding a book to a user's personal library, etc.)
        Create the necessary controllers for handling the requests and interacting with the database using sequelize

Week 4:

    Implement commenting and social network features for the books using React and Express:
        Add the necessary components and logic for allowing users to leave comments on books
        Add the necessary back-end routes and controllers for handling comment data and storing it in the database using sequelize
        Add the necessary components and logic for allowing users to like/dislike books and add them to their favorites
        Add the necessary back-end routes and controllers for handling social network data and storing it in the database using sequelize
    Implement search functionality for the library using React and Express:
        Add a search bar to the library pages in React and implement the logic for sending search requests to the server
        Create the necessary back-end routes and controllers for handling search requests and returning the relevant data from the database using sequelize

Week 5:

    Test and debug the website:
        Test the website's functionality and fix any bugs or issues that are found
    Deploy the website to a hosting service:
        Choose a hosting service such as Heroku, AWS or Google Cloud
        Follow the instructions of the hosting service for deploying your application
